.. _Blocklist:

Blocklist
---------

If you want to use a peer-blocklist (you can enable this in the web
interface if you are using the trunk version of Freetz), you have to
know that you have to provide a blocklist yourself. The simplest is to
make a 'update-blocklist.sh' with the content below and to invoke it
daily or so using cron (don't forget to make the file executable).

.. code:: wiki

   #!/var/tmp/sh

   cd /path-to/bittorrent/config/blocklists/
   if wget -q http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/level1.gz ; then
           rm -f level1 && gunzip level1.gz
           killall -HUP transmission-daemon
           logger -s -t transmission "blocklist updated"
   else
           logger -s -t transmission "blocklist not updated"
   fi

This can be done from the transmission web interface too now.

.. _Numberofpeers:

Number of peers
---------------

It is probably a good idea to reduce the number of peers by editing the
*…/bittorrent/config/settings.json* file:

.. code:: wiki

       "peer-limit-global": 150,
       "peer-limit-per-torrent": 50,

You have to stop transmission before changing this! Or you could use
this command to reload the config file:

.. code:: wiki

   killall -HUP transmission-daemon

This can be done from the transmission web interface too now.

.. _Memoryusage:

Memory usage
------------

Huge, relatively.

You will probably need a swap file and you may want to increase
`​swappiness <http://lwn.net/Articles/83588/>`__ to 80 or something (in
Freetz WebIF since `[6886] </changeset/6886>`__).

+-------------------------+------------+-----------+
|                         | **VmSize** | **VmRSS** |
+-------------------------+------------+-----------+
| No blocklist            | ~8,5 mB    | ~6 mB     |
+-------------------------+------------+-----------+
| level1 blocklist        | ~17 mB     | ~8 mB     |
+-------------------------+------------+-----------+
| One torrent + blocklist | ~19 mB     | ~12 mB    |
+-------------------------+------------+-----------+

You can monitor these values easily with the patch from ticket
`#1308 </ticket/1308>`__.

.. _Limitmemoryusage:

Limit memory usage
------------------

To prevent memory shortage (could cause reboots and crashing processes):

.. code:: wiki

       "cache-size-mb": 1,
       "open-file-limit": 32,

The cache size is by default 2 MiB and the open file limit is by default
32.

To minimize the number of connections you could decide to forward TCP
traffic only and not UDP traffic.

.. _Watchdog:

Watchdog
--------

It may be necessary to disable the watchdog by adding this line to for
example *rc.custom*:

.. code:: wiki

       echo "disable">/dev/watchdog
