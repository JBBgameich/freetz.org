"*PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.*"

.. _Memoryusage:

Memory usage
------------

It works, but it needs a lot of memory, so a swap file is advisable
(about 32 MB will do in most cases).

.. code:: wiki

   -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root       5036004 Apr 25 18:41 php-cgi

.. code:: wiki

   VmPeak:    10740 kB
   VmSize:    10740 kB The size of the virtual memory allocated to the process
   VmRSS:      3068 kB The amount of memory mapped in RAM ( instead of swapped out )

This is why `​fast-CGI <http://www.fastcgi.com/>`__ is better too:
instead of loading the PHP binary over and over again it stays in
memory, also giving the system the opportunity to swap out unused parts
of it.

Another thing is that *php.ini* will use valuable flash space and is
quite big. A solution is to make a symbolic link to an USB storage
device:

.. code:: wiki

   cp /tmp/flash/php.ini /var/media/ftp/uFlash/hiawatha/php.ini
   rm /tmp/flash/php.ini
   ln -s /var/media/ftp/uFlash/hiawatha/php.ini /tmp/flash/php.ini
   modsave
