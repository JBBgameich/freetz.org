authorized-keys
---------------

The authorized_keys allows you to access the router with pre-shared keys
i.s.o. just a password. To use pre-shared keys you need to generate a
public/private keypair and add the public key to the authorized_keys
file.

   You also need to setup your SSH client for using the pre-shared key.
