`​XySSL <http://www.ohloh.net/p/xyssl>`__\ *is an open-source
cryptographic library for embedded systems. It provides standard crypto
block: AES, SHA-1, X.509, etc. as well as higher lever protocols: SSL v3
and TLS v1. XySSL has been ported on a number of architectures,
including ARM, PowerPC, MIPS, and Motorola 68000. Its already small
memory footprint can be easily reduced to 50k for a basic SSL client or
server, by modifying a single .h configuration file. XySSL is currently
used in several open-source (GPL) and closed-source projects, such as
Adobe's flash player.*

Inzwischen wird XySSL nicht mehr weiter entwickelt. Der Nachfolger heißt
`​PolarSSL <http://www.polarssl.org/>`__.
