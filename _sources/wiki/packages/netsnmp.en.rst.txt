Net-SNMP
--------

| Net-SNMP (**S**\ imple **N**\ etwork **M**\ anagement **P**\ rotocol)
  includes an open source SNMPd agent to monitor and administer SNMP
  capable network devices like routers and switches.
| You can poll the snmpd agent on the router to obtain e.g. interface or
  CPU statistics information and display this in a nice graph with the
  help of a program like `​MRTG <http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/>`__
| More info about Net-SNMP can be found via:
  `​http://www.net-snmp.org/ <http://www.net-snmp.org/>`__

Creating a Feetz Image with Net-SNMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Follow the directions from the `Wiki <../index.en.html#>`__
| After the following step you can configure the packages you want to
  have included in your image.

.. code:: wiki

   make menuconfig

Make sure the following is selected (so I have 1 out of 3 selected):

.. code:: wiki

   Package selection  ---> Standard packages  ---> [*] Net-SNMP 5.4.2.1 snmpd
   Package selection  ---> Standard packages  ---> [ ]   With openssl encryption (NEW)
   Package selection  ---> Standard packages  ---> [ ]   With zlib compression (NEW)

Setup in Freetz web-interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

conf
^^^^

| First you should create a snmpd.conf file. This file contains all
  configuration options for Net-SNMP, including a community string,
  which you can regard as a password for access control. [[br] A full
  description of all possible parameters can be found in the online
  manual page:
  `​http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpd.conf.html <http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpd.conf.html>`__
| You can edit the snmpd.conf file via the Freetz web-interface via
  Net-SNMP > snmpd.conf

If you would like to have a minimal config you can use the following:

.. code:: wiki

   rocommunity public
   rwcommunity private

| This way access contol is only based on the communiy string.

| I found an example config with more accss contol options in one of the
  attachments in this thread:
  `​http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=122073 <http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=122073>`__
| This shows how to control access based on source IP address range with
  additional options to restrict access.

   access  MyROGroup    ""      any       noauth    exact  all      none   none

| If you only allow access from inside your trusted network you can use
  the default community string, which is for readonly **public** and for
  readwrite **private**.
| More information on the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM) can be
  found on the `​Net-SNMP
  Wiki <http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Vacm>`__

setup
^^^^^

| After saving a snmpd.conf file using the Net-SNMP > snmpd.conf setup
  page you can enable Net-SNMP to start automatically at bootup.

^^^^^^

| With many Linux distributions you als have snmp tools included like
  snmpget, snmpset, snmpwalk, …
| A quick guide how to use these tools can be found `​on the
  net-snmp.org
  site <http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorials>`__.

Some commands: To get a list of interface descriptions (ifDesc):

   snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community string> 192.168.178.1
   .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2

..

   snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community string> -O a 192.168.178.1
   .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2

To get a list of all available objects:

   snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community string> 192.168.178.1 .1

.. _MRTG:

MRTG
----

| The Multi Router Traffic Grapher will allow you to generate nice
  graphs of the data available via SNMP.
| This can be system information like uptime, interface information and
  statistics, and more.
| The graphs can help a lot with trouble clearing issues, both with the
  FritsBox (e.g. CPU memory), and in the network.
| For more info see the `​MRTG site <http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/>`__.

| Here an example on the graph you can generate:
