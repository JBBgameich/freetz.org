If you need instant help you can try the fritzbox IRC channel. Some of
the developers are known to sometimes hang out on there: ##fritzbox on
Freenode.

.. code:: bash

   Server="chat.freenode.net"
   Port="6667"
   Channel="##fritzbox"

If you have any trouble while connecting (Unauthorized connection),
please use an alternative server. Maybe you need one from your country.
You could find an overview about the Freenod-servers here:
